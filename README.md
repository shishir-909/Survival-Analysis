# Reliability Analysis

Recently, I have been slow-reading the book Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data, Second Edition (John P. Klein and Melvin L. Moescheberger). Although the techniques presented in this book focus on applications in biology and medicine, the same statistical tools can also be applied to disciplines ranging from engineering to economics and demography. I have a backgound in mechanical engineering and this project is my attempt at applying these statistical methods to data from Reliability engineering. The datasets used for various articles in this project are the ones that have been used as examples in another excellent book: Statistical Methods for Reliability Data, Second Edition (William Q. Meeker, Luis A. Escobar, Francis G. Pascual).

As I finish reading a specific chapter from the Survival Analysis book, I will pick a relevant dataset from the second book in order to illustrate application of the methods learnt. I will extensively use the "survival" package in R wherever possible. This README will be updated after every post.
