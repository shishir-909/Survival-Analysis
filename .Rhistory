The first level has to be for "censored" observations as per survival package documentation. Since there are no censored observations in my dataset, I coded rep(1,0) for censored.
istate = rep("entry", 79)) ## "entry" is the initial state before any of the 3 competing risk event can happen. Since this is a competing risk scenario - ther are multiple risks, but only one event per subject. That is, any given subject can go from "entry to risk 1" or "entry to risk 2" and so on. We cannot have subjects going from "entry to risk 1 to risk 2" in a competing risks scenario.
