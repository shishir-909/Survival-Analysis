# Introduction

In this article, we will analyse vehicle shock absorb-er failure time data and estimate a few basic survival quantities^[Failure time data is also known as survival data, life data, event-time data or reliability data, depending on the field of study.]. The data contains failure times (in kilometers driven) and the mode of failure. We will ignore the mode of failure for this article and will only consider whether a failure occurred or not i.e. censored. 

Survival function $S(t)$ is defined as the probability that a unit's time to failure ($T$) is greater than some time ($t$)^[Time is measured in kilometers in this example]. 

$$S(t) = Pr(T > t)$$

# Kaplan Meir Curve

A non-parametric estimate of the survival function is given by the product-limit estimator, proposed by Kaplan and Meir (1958)^[Kaplan, E. L. and Meier, P. Nonparametric Estimation from Incomplete Observations. *Journal of the American Statistical Association* 53 (1958): 457â€“481.]

$$S(t) = $$

A short description of these basic survival quantities along with a few mathematical formulas will also be inc will also be mentioned briefly, but   estimating basic survival quantities like the survival function, its standard error, confidence intervals, confidence bands and mean survival for data from a
